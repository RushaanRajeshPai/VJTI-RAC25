                                into consideration. The design is then subject

                                Currently, VJTI Racing has two teams under its
                                wing. Team Motorbreath comprises students mainly
                                from the third-year building an all-terrain
                                vehicle, with the main objective of
                                participating in SAE BAJA competitions. Team
                                ForzaVJTI, our latest addition, consists of
                                students from the second-year, established to
                                introduce deserving youngsters to the automotive
                                world as early as possible. They will work on
                                manufacturing a go-kart, mainly to participate
                                in ISIE IKR. The club also hosts workshops and
                                events for the students of the college to evoke
                                an interest in the technical aspects of our
                                craft, and familiarise students with the topics
                                and processes involved in the manufacture of our
                                vehicles.
